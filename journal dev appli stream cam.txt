2013 12 13 :
today version saved : working app for 1 shot at 115kbds
able to handle starting the camera at 38 kbds or 115kbds and make multiple retries for good file lentgh reading
minimum testing to ensure best latencies compromises to ensures minimum quality of data downloaded

used turtle http server example : seems to be enough simple for me
infinte loop on VC0706_stream doesn't work : best is 1 frame / 5.
To be tested : implement DMA use : 2013 12 13 to be used

2013 12 15 :
evrlasting picture taking IS WORKING !!! saved under 2013 12 15 VC0706_java continous take.zip
the issue was with the non re-initialisation of iostreams during connection/reconnection to camera
no way to take everlsating picture without disconnection, this means 1 fps max ;-(
using the TurtleMeatSimpleHttpServer modified server

a good track to implement simple jpg streaming : 
implement a class from vc0706 and call its getbufferedoutputstream method, this has to be implemented of course
then construct html page with enw data in bufferedinput stream

trying to stream the output file from VC0706 java program through a "simple" node.js http server : 
http://nodejs.developpez.com/tutoriels/javascript/node-js-livre-debutant/
struggling within the mod displaying an image
exec method not tested yet, anyway VC0706 java program has to be modified to return the image

The following push example one need to be tested AS IS

html tip to write an image :
     res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'image/gif' });

    success in streaming data to browser using http://blog.marcon.me/post/31143865164/send-images-through-websockets
need to : 
proper cast data and customize web page    
clean up jar to  : remove inconsistent stdout, output base 64 image

inconstient stdout removed ("wait for byte error"), no need to remove RxTx version display because only at startup

2014 01 01 (happy new year)
generate a JAr providing base64 output using the following tip :
http://myjeeva.com/how-to-convert-image-to-string-and-string-to-image-in-java.html

no changes :-(
